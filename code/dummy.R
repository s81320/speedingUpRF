looking for a script file containing a certain string, like my_best_function ?
  
  use search_for_text.R !!

This is a dummy text file for looking for words
when you look for a 
code string somewhere in the many code files.
Darn. Where did i save the code I need for task xyz ??
  Maybe I can look up chapter names?
  Or figure / table numbers?
  Then someone should have tagged the script files with that info!
